# SAN-Digital-Twin
SAN Digital Twin is a software-only framework that creates a virtual replica of a Storage Area Network (SAN) to simulate failures and recovery mechanisms in real-time. It enables SAN administrators and researchers to test different failure handling strategies, measure performance impact,and validate recovery policies without costly hardware setups.
